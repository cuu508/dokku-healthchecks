Healthchecks on Dokku
=====================

Docker image to run the [healthchecks](https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks)
django application on Dokku

*N.B.* Due to no tagging on the healthchecks repository this will always build with the latest commit

## Building

```
docker build -t cuu508/healthchecks .
```

## Running

```
docker run -p 9090:9090 cuu508/healthchecks
```

The container is now accepting requests on port 9090.

## Admin Access

By default no admin user is created. To create your first admin user connect to your running docker container and run:

```
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

You will now be able to login to the admin at http://localhost:9090/admin.

*N.B.* There is no validation so ensure you correctly set an email address and password or you may find yourself unable to login.
